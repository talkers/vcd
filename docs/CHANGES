vcd change log - Changes made since version 1.31
================================================
- = comments about changes
* = comments of particular interest

Anything before 1.31 I dont remember :)
It was mostly adding the database and softboots and fixing tons and tons of 
bugs. The first ``offical'' version was 1.07.   

Note: This code was 'born' in June of 1995.


1.32 (April 17th, 1996)
-----------------------
[db.c]
  - removed "./files/players/" from player files and updated db.c accordingly 
  - removed member "fn" from struture user and replaced it with "key"
  - Mostly, I just improved the db. Too much stuff to remember :)
  - Made player with datafile #1 "GOD" 
[parse.c]
  - Added command ".*" and function togglewhosubstr();


1.33 (April 29th, 1996)
-----------------------
[parse.c]
  - Added the command ".i" and modified fingerpage(); accordingly. 
[log.c]
  - Added smartlog(); to avoid logging common unimportant errors.
    Updated log() and logerr() accordingly.
[db.c]
  - Added get_new_reg(); function. Code was removed from registernew(); and
    placed into the new function.	
  

2.0.0 (June 23rd, 1996) (renamed from 1.34 after mail was added)
---------------------
[*.c] 
  - Added all prototypes of local functions.
[parse.c] 
  - Alphabetized the command parser.
  - Cleaned up emote checking in functions: talk(), yells(); and private().
  - Improved the output of fingerpage(); It now lines up all of the names
    and closing bracket whether or not 'H', 'P', or 'Q' is toggled and whether
    or not the line number is one digit or two.
[chat.c] 
  - in function checkidle() removed:
        if (timeouts) return;
  - added it to the statements:
	} else if (!num && timeouts) {
    	if (timeouts && (systemtime - lastcheck) > idletimeout)
[db.c]
  - removed the free((struct user *) dummy);'s from dbnuke();
  - removed the free((struct user *) dummy) from display_saved_user() and
    placed it in finger_user_name();
  - It screwed up the linked index list in memory when I placed the
    malloc inside finger_user_name() for some reason. This happened with the
    addition of the free(); (see above)	
  - added function notreg();	
* - I totally rewrote get_new_reg() and called it get_first_free_key();
    This is _MUCH_ better because nuked user keys were previously not reusable.
    With this new code a new registered user is not automatically attached to
    the end of the index linked-list. It will be inserted at the first 
    available key. 
  - Changed struct user member "key" to int type from unsigned long. Changed
    all "%lu"'s to "%d" that dealt with key. Changed the (unsigned)atol()'s to
    atoi();
  - Removed that stupid for loop and the if statements from load_user(). 
[softboot.c]
  - Changed "key"'s from "%lu" to "%d" 
[killvcd.c]
  - Replaced killvcd* with a shell script
[talker.c]
* - Fixed the memory leak with softboots running under FreeBSD. When you 
    softbooted the haven under FreeBSD the amount of mem the haven took up
    jumped about 1.5 to 2 times what it was before. This did not happen under
    Linux. Linux must be smarter 8-). I simply moved "if (!sboot) {" from it's
    location and stuck it after the switch-case statement. This let the haven
    fork itself off again.
[help.c]
  - Cleaned up the help parser. Should no longer crash under SunOS.
[mail.c]
  - added mail.
  - wrote functions countmail(), appendmailspool(), sendmail(), readmail(),
    deletemail().
[lists.h]
  - added flag NEWMAIL;


2.0.1 (July 5th, 1996)
---------------------------
[]
  - renamed writelisttext() to writelist()
    renamed writewrapdesc() to writewrap()
    renamed writedesctext() to writedesc()
  - removed all extern declarations from *.c files
[db.c]
  - added string searches to showreg(); ".reg A" whould show all reg'd users
    whose name starts with 'a' or 'A'. ".reg Ang" would show all names 
    starting with Ang. Case doesn't matter. ".reg" would just show the number
    of reg'd users and last key.
[parse.c]
  - split file up into commands.c and parse.c
[externs.h]
  - added all external function declarations and variable definitions.


2.0.2 (September 22nd, 1996)
----------------------------
[io.c] 
  - Fixed spam protection. When I had originally changed it so you could spam
    in your own channel I neglected to prevent .p bombing or spam thru yells.
    This included adding a new struct user member "commands" and modifying only
    processinput() and setting new->commands = 0 in logonnew() from chat.c.
[commands.c]
  - Fixed the ">> Stats saved."
	      ">> Please choose a REAL name." bug. this happened when a 
    registered user typed '.n'	
  - Got rid of WHOSUBSTR and togglewhosubstr(). .* does strict .w searches.
    ".* ab" finds only "ab" and not "abc".  Case is unimportant.
[io.c]
  - added sendts() function. 


2.0.3 (November 18th, 1996)
---------------------------
[*.c]
  - removed #ifndef NODATABASE/#endif's
  - removed #ifdef DEBUG/#endif's
[vc.*]
  - updated vc.help
[parse.c]
  - Modified spam protection so only ``.c'' , ``.p'', and ``.y'' count
    as commands.  This is helpful for people who have long tf macros that
    exceed the spam limit for commands.


2.1.0 (January 15th, 1997)
-------------------------------------------
[custom.h]
  - added #define GODSNAME
[power.h]
  - Got rid of level 0.
  - added #define P_* flags. Makes it easier to set the power level needed
    to execute a certain command. added checkpower() in power.c.
[commands.c]
  - in setcolors(); Added command .A? to see your current color settings
  - in private(); Added last .p.  Just do .p <msg> and it will .p the last
    user you successfully .p'd.
  - yells(); Trying to yell while hushed will now unhush you and let you yell.
[db.c]
  - User key #1 is no longer GOD...level four's are once again.
    The name defined by GODSNAME in custom.h is the supreme god.
  - added function do_reg_command(). This function checks if the user is
    registered before executing a command. If they aren't, it gives them
    a message. Any command that you want a user to be registered to execute
    should be fed through this. Removed notreg().  
  - added seturl(); Used to let users set their URLs.
  - added setlocation(); Used to let users set their location.
  - added change_user_data();  Allows a GOD to change a saved user's power
    level or password.
  - removed update_db();
[help.c]
  - replaced DASHLINE with a title bar of the command user is getting help on.
[io.c]
  - removed sendts(); from vcd... it caused "noise" for some users, almost
    like the '#' problem for mac users.
[mail.c]
  - .R will now wrap long mails for ppl without tf or WRAP toggled.
[parse.c]
  - further alphabetized parser.
  - added case 'U' seturl() - see [db.c].
  - added case 'L' setlocation() - see [db.c]
  - added case '@P' - see below. 
  - Renamed the following commands:
    .W is now .~	(paged who output)
    .S is now .W	(wrap)
    .smail is now .S    (send mail)
    .rmail is now .R	(read mail)
    .dmail is now .D	(delete mail)
    .s is now .T	(toggles)
    .P is now .s	(p suppress)
    .X is now .P	(Password)
[power.c]
  - added checkpower(). Compares a user's power level to the minimum level
    needd to execute certain power commands.
  - added insuf_power(). Gives messages if a user tries to perform a command
    on someone they have no power over. 


2.2.0 (April 21st, 1997)
---------------------------

   This is pretty lame. I didn't document it as I made the changes. There 
   were just too many. If you can't live with that, too bad. Most of the  
   new stuff invloves "mods.c" and the implementation of the modules and 
   asynchronous name service.
		-- Angelo

* New directory structure.
  - Sub-dirs inside /players and /mail
  - fixed paths elsewhere in source code where required.
[chat.c]
  - modified checkidle() to return the time the next idle check should be done.
    This introduced the nextcheck variable.
[custom.h] 
  - re-organized this file so it looks nicer. Added ROOT.
  - changed path of VCDINDEX to ../files/vc.index
[macros.h]
  - added powerover macro to determine which player outranks another.
[commands.c]
  - The old color command .A is now .C
  - all module commands start with .#
  - To take caps it is now .@l
  - Help for power is now .@?<topic> or .@?<command>
  - To ban a site is now .@b<string>
  - To unban a site it's now .@u<site id>
  - Fixed fingerpage() so it now does a user's brackets correct whether
    or not they have a 1, 2, or 3 digit line number.
[db.c]
  - New format for saving/loading users. Similar to how softboot images
    are saved and loaded. Makes it easier to update the database.
  - passwords are now encrypted. added function cryptpassword() which
    generates a random salt for every password.
  - got rid of all references to change_user_data(). I didn't like it.
[help.c]
  - got rid of getpowerhelp(). getuserhelp() now does both.
[io.c]
  - Deleted writedescfile(), writefile() is all you need now.
[lists.c]
  - got rid of do_ban()
[mod.c]
  - Added modules a la Joel Ward's (Valtaire) Opium Den modules.
  - This required hacking up chat.c and io.c, if you really want to know
    what was changed, compare it to version 2.0.3.
  - Events were added. i.e. Asynchronous name service. If the mod dies,
    the haven will take over name service.
  - Parse strings were added as well. Every command that should be intercepted
    by a module gets it's own parse string. The parse string holds the 
    command name, the format string, and points to the mod that owns it.
    READ MOD.DOC for more help.
[softboot.c]
  - added user port to softboots. For some reason this was left out.


	That's it, REALLY lame documentation for this version.
	Who the hell reads the CHANGES anyway? :)


3.0.0 (July 28th, 1997)
-----------------------
* Got rid of externs.h. Every .c file now has a corresponding .h file.
  vcd.h includes every *.h file, so you only need to include vcd.h now.
* Another new directory structure. Keys are now put into a directory with the
  corresponding first letter (or other) of a user's name.
[chat.c]
  - Ops will no longer idle out.
  - There is no longer a default description.
[db.c]
  - Added purge() to delete old users.
  - Changed verify_user() so it no longer looks up the user in the database
    twice. Just passed the pointer from changename(). (commands.c)
  - Got rid of total time connected. It is dumb anyway on a haven where users
    are famous for idling for days at a time. This required getting rid of
    "totsecs" from struct user.
[io.c]
  - In function extractline() finally added ^H ('\177') delete support
  - Added long idle time formats, i.e. 1 Day 5 Hours 17 Minutes 7 Seconds
[lists.c]
  - Moved the exit message to nukeuser(). This way the '>> Stats saved.'
    and exit messages are printed in the correct order.
[mods.c]
  - Created dup_module(). It dup2()'s a module's fd to the highest open fd.
  - Created execute_event(). Is similar to writelist(). Passes the event_id
    along with a list of strings to module that owns event_id. Allows minimal
    hacking of the code to send stuff to modules.
  - Created send_pstr(); This sends the user's line number, expanded arguement
    string, and the user's input to the module that owns the parse string.
    NEW: The $l and $i substitutions in expand args no longer exist. Every parse
	 string sent to a mod now has the user's line as the FIRST arguement and
         their input as the LAST arguement
[socket.c]
  - Added the fd_master_*() functions and got rid of the master global variable.    
[talker.c]
  - Added system_flags.
 
[/mods]
  - wrote mod.template.c. This can be used to capture the arguements from
    a packet that is sent to a module. Hack it up to your heart's content.


VCD 3.0.1 (September 1st, 1997)
-------------------------------
[mail.c]
  * Fixed a bug with .R#. If you typed .R5 but only had three mail messages,
    I neglected to close the player's mail file. This ate up a file
    descriptor which is VERY bad :)
  - Fixed another bug where if you didn't type .R followed by a number it
    would say you didnt have that many messages.
  - Various other small formatting changes with mail functions to make output
    appear nicer.


VCD 3.0.2 (October 29th, 1997)
------------------------------ 
  - Removed Makefile from the vcd root directory. We only need one Makefile
    now. It is in the src subdirectory.
[Makefile]
  - Added "make linux", "make freebsd" or "make solaris" options. People
    never would read the make file and see they needed to uncomment  
    -lcrypt for freebsd. This takes care of that.
[log.c]
  - Fixed a small bug with smartlog().  FreeBSD did not recognize the 
    EXFULL constant.


VCD 3.1.0 (January 4th, 1998)
-------------------------------
- Various asthetic changes to make the code look nicer :)
- Updated the help files! (I think they're pretty complete)
[chat.c]
  - Fixed a bug in logonnew. Was new->descrip[DESCMAX] = '\0'; Should have
    been new->descrip[0] = '\0'; This gave every new user logging in the
    description of the last person to set one :)
  - Fixed a bug with checkidle(). This occurred when you changed the idletimeout
    to a new length. The next check would still depend on what the OLD 
    nextcheck value was. This fix required checking for idlers when the
    timeout length was changed in [power.c] toggletimeouts()
[commands.c]
  - Yelling when hushed will no longer unhush you and let you yell. That
    was a stupid feature implemeted in 2.1.0.
  - in changename(). Added me->level = JOEUSER when a registered user changes 
    their name. This prevents you from accidently (or on purpose ;) loging in
    as root, changing your name, and registering your new name. This would
    keep you at root's power level. When you quit, you'd be saved with
    root level access. I don't know why the power level wasnt zeroed out a
    long time ago.
  - in fingeruser(). Removed the showing of the user's port. Potential
    for abuse by identing someone and finding out their email. Also changed
    a lot of writelist's to writetext's
  - added .@c; Allows registration of a name for a user who is not logged in.
[db.c]
  - added functions init_new_entry(), create_root(), create_user()
[mail.c]
  - various minor changes to readmail(). got rid of stripcr()'s, made arrays
    smaller, removed a sprintf, added some DASHLINEs, and added wrapping for
    single messages.
[mods.c]
  - Modules now claim multiple events. struct module event was switched from 
    int to fd_set.   
  - Added struct channel to module structure.
  - Mods can now be channeled with the mod "channel" command.
  - Mods can write to all user's in it's channel with mod "writechan" command.
[power.c]
  - Got rid of checkpasswd(). No more .q power ups.
  - Got rid of showpasswd(). 
[power.h]
  - Redefined power level values.
  - added power_names[] array.
[talker.c]
  - Added check for root user on boot up. If there is no root user one will
    be created. You will be prompted for root's password.
[socket.c]
  - renamed fd_master_isset*() functions to fd_ready() and fd_master_isset(). 

VCD 4.0.0 (May 15th, 1998 -> December 2nd, 1998)
--------------------------
renamed files dir to etc.
renamed vc.badsites to vc.deny
moved some #defines around.
[*.c] 
  - changed many writelists to writetexts
[*.h]
  - got rid of sysdep.h
  - moved filepaths from custom.h to files.h
[channels.h]
  - added struct module to the channel structure. re-wrote how modules are
    attached to channels.
[board.c]
  - moved board commands from commands.c and io.c to board.c
  - Fixed tiny bug on read_messages....added defaultmsg when file doesnt exist
[chat.c]   
  - added not_system(NAMESERVICE) to checkban in newuser();
[channels.c]
  - added the concept of a public channel i.e. one that cannot be locked.
  - created the concept of a user owning a channel, user to create it owns it
    -- only the owner can lock/unlock it
    -- if an owner quits/leaves the channel, the next user to lock it owns it
  - Added the .k command to kick a user from a channel...boots them to main
  - Got rid of the stupid for loop in delete_channel() ... added channeltail
    variable instead.
  - Moved channelhead definition from lists.c to channels.c
        (why wasnt it there to begin with YEARS ago???)
[commands.c]
  - Fixed long hostnames. It will now show you the last HOSTMAX characters of
    the site name, instead of the first HOSTMAX. This way you can save the 
    domain name, etc.
  - reformatted the .ban list accordingly
  - changed the format of .f and .F to look like UNIX finger
[db.c]
  - Completely rewrote the database. names, passwords, and keys are no longer
    stored in memory. completely got rid of keys. a user's data is stored in
    a file that is a lowercase version of their name.
  - changed tags in save_user and load_user to more than 4 chars
[io.c]
  - Renamed stripltspaces to stripwhite
[lists.c]
  - Renamed nukeuser to disconnect
  - Modified disconnect so it won't print the exit and save_user
    message if there was a read error.
[log.c]
  - Reformatted the log functions
[mail.c]
  - updated mail funtions to work with the new database.
[mods.c]   
  - revised send_pstr so the haven doesnt crash if the module has no arguments.
  - fixed dup_module...should have been MAXLOGINS-2
  - Fixed killmodule and delmodule. 
  - Moved kill to delmodule
  - Fixed mods so their channels will be deleted accordingly
  - Got rid of the concept of a user owning a module.
  - Got rid of .#p and .#w
[parse.c]
  - changed .#l to .@L
  - changed .#k to .@K
[talker.c]
  - changed limit.rlim_cur =  MAXLOGINS;
